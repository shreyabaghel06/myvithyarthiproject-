# THE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Managing​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ a library manually consumes a lot of time, is prone to errors, and is mostly inefficient. The conventional ways of keeping track of book inventories, issuing books, and handling user data may cause the disappearance of books, wrong records, and services that are slow. The goal of this work is to replace these methods with automated ones to make them more accurate, efficient, and ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌user-friendly.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

1.Books​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ should be managed through the library where the details of the books can be added, modified, or deleted.

2.The library should keep records of books that are issued and returned with exact status updates.

3.The library should keep records of users who have different access privileges (for example librarian and member).

4.The library will benefit from the search and reporting features which will be used as tools for decision-making.

5.This scheme will be a desktop application with a graphical user interface, which will be appropriate for libraries of a small to medium ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌size.

TARGET USERS

1.Librarians or library staff responsible for managing the library inventory and user transactions.

2.Library members or students who borrow books and track their borrowing history.

HIGH LEVEL FEATURES 

1.Book​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ management: perform adding, updating, deleting, and searching of books.

2.Member management: register and manage user information.

3.Transaction management: record the issuance of return of books along with tracking the status.

4.Reporting tools for popular books, active members, and overdue ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌items.
